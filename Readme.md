## Selection criteria

### Preliminary selections

[The distribution of different variables](./notes/preliminary_selections.md)


- kaon selection
	- kaonID>0.2
- $\pi^0$ selection
	- gamma
		- clusterNHits > 1.5 and 0.2967 < clusterTheta < 2.6180
		- gamma in different range:
			- clusterReg=1: E>0.1 GeV
			- clusterReg=2: E>0.06 GeV
			- clusterReg=3: E>0.1 GeV
		- cluster shape: cluseterE9E21>0.9
	- $\pi^0$
		- the mass window used now: $0.111 \lt M_{\pi_{0}} \lt 0.153 \rm~GeV/c^2$, invariant mass between m_mean +- 3sigma.
        - $|\cos\theta_{helicity}|<0.95$

### Best $B^0$ candidate selection

We used two variables to select the best $B^0$ candidate: 
- $\pi^0$ mass constrained chi2 
- chiProb of $B^0$ vertex fit chi2

Selection strategy:
- Firstly, we select the $B^0$ candidate whose $\pi^0$ with lowest chi2. 
- If there are still multi $B^0$ candidate, we select the $B^0$ candidate with higher chiProb.

## Continuum suppression

MC sample: MC 15 run-indepent qqbar sample

We used FBDT to do continuum suppression, which is introduced in the [basf2 website](https://software.belle2.org/development/sphinx/online_book/basf2/cs.html).

We used the [MVA package](https://software.belle2.org/development/sphinx/mva/doc/index-01-mva.html) in basf2 to mix signal and background sample, and evaluate the result of training.


## Flavor Tag

We also used the method indroduced in [basf2 sofeware website](https://software.belle2.org/development/sphinx/online_book/basf2/flavor_tagging.html)


## Study of background from generic BBbar
